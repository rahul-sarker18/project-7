            <h3>1. Difference between local storage and session storage</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">Local storage has data save and session storage also has data save. But there is a big difference between them. Reloading data of local storage does not go away. And data of session storage goes away when reloaded.</p>

            <h3>2. Difference between global scope and block scope</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>

            <h3>3. GET undefined</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>

            <h3>4. How javascript event loop works</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">the Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
